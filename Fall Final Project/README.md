Fall final project web development 2015
This is my website for the Fall Semester final project of my web development class in 2015.

In order to have all the files run properly download the html files and place them in their own folder. In that same folder create three other folders called "css" "js" and "images"
Place the proper files in their respctive folders and run index.html
Hope you enjoy me work!
