				As the anxiety inducing pi day (MIT result) is approaching, I've been reflecting more about my dreams. 
				MIT has been in my mind ever since 7th grade when my middle school took us on a trip in Boston. 
				One of our activities was a tour of Harvard, and on our way there via Massachusetts avenue, 
				we passed by a grand building with steps leading up to a platform supporting eight marble columns that held up a frieze that said "William Barton Rogers Founder."
				"And there is MIT, it's a good school for engineering," announced the tour guide. Although I was given such a brief introduction to the school, I decided that is <span class = "boldSpan"> where I wanted to go. </span>
