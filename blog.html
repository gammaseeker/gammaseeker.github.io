			<h2>Failure</h2>
			<p>
				<i>Sigh..</i> Let's try this again: Prompt: The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?


			</p>
			<p>
				I take everything for granted. That's what I've been told my entire life. I have big ideas sure, the ambition, but I could never bring them to life. I am always too focused on the future to appreciate what I have in the present. I want more prestige, I want to refine my talent, I want to be put on a pedestal.
			</p>
			<p>
				I entered my senior year with these three desires in mind. After the Con Edison internship, I created a support network and finally saw success within myself. I was on top of the world and was ready to ride that momentum to generate more success in my final year of high school.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was a certain vision that I had upon entering my final year of high school. Two conditions, if satisfied, I would be able to say: "Senior year was a success. It was my Triumph!" The conditions were: admission to MIT and getting the girl I liked. Scratch that, adored. Ironically, those successes were never generated. Rather, my year was filled with failures, one after another.
			</p>
			<p>
				The weight of sheer disappointment has yielded both a crippling feeling of unworthiness, and a deep desire to strive to become a better person. It is both beautiful and terrible, that the only way I have grown is via failures, one after another.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, I have experienced the repercussions of my desires. A person who I once held dear to me is now a stranger due to the actions I made to chase my wants. I'll never forget that it ended like this. I'll never forget the deep-seated sting of interpersonal failure. But there's also another side to this tragedy. The hopeful fervor of Fall 2016, the fun times on the winter trip, the support network I've built up at Con Ed and the overall growth I've made from depression in freshman year to where I am today. The disappointments and losses will never take that away from me. With only two months remaining in my senior year of high school, I cannot be certain that this relationship can be rekindled. However, I absolutely refuse to allow this situation to happen again.

				These are my last two months, I won't take them for granted.

			<h2>Dreams</h2>
			<p>
				As the anxiety inducing pi day (MIT result) is approaching, I've been reflecting more about my dreams. MIT has been in my mind ever since 7th grade when my middle school took us on a trip in Boston. One of our activities was a tour of Harvard, and on our way there via Massachusetts avenue, we passed by a grand building with steps leading up to a platform supporting eight marble columns that held up a frieze that said "William Barton Rogers Founder." "And there is MIT, it's a good school for engineering," announced the tour guide. Although I was given such a brief introduction to the school, I decided that is <strong>where I wanted to go</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				ast forward to April 23rd, 2016, MIT announced they were holding a open house event celebrating their 100 years in Cambridge. Upon hearing the news, I immediately rushed to my dad, convincing him to make the trip to Boston. We woke up at 4:00am and drove to Boston, arriving to MIT at 9:00am. As we crossed the Charles River to reach the school's entrance, we were greeted with a banner that read "Welcome to MIT." A surge of excitement struck my body as I realized I was about to experience the "nerd paradise." As I roamed throughout campus, I had the privilege of observing creative projects fueled by passion from an ice cream 3-D printer to a solar powered raspberry pi designed to mine bitcoins.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite these innovative creations, what stuck with me most was that purple banner. When the college process began in senior year I entertained the idea of how great it would feel to see it again except welcoming students to the class of 2021. Welcoming me. Not as a visitor, but as a student. As a result, I promised myself that I would do all I can to see that "Welcome to MIT" banner again, but as a student.
			</p>
			<p>
				In exactly one week from today I will know if I get to see that banner again. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
