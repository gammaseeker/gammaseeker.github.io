# Drone-Google-Maps-Application
Web Development Spring Semester Final Project 2016
I created a website that implements database support and the Google Maps API
The website is themed around drones. Google Maps is used to show the user zones that are recommended, legal, semi-legal and illegal to fly a drone in: New York City, Boston, Washington D.C, and Los Angeles.
