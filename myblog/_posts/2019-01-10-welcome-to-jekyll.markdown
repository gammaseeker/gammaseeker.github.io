Like many software engineers and computer science students throughout their careers, they hit a rut. They begin to lose their passion for programming. I remember in my senior year of high school, I was so hungry to expand my knowledge in computer science beyond my only programming class AP Computer Science A. I took it upon myself to self study data structures and algorithms, a topic well beyond the high school curriculum. I would sacrifice my winter and spring breaks by going to the New York Public Library to keep on learning about this topic. With every new data structure I learned and implemented, it felt like I was leveling up in skill.

This decision to learn this topic eventually led to one of my greatest feats: a software engineering internship at Bloomberg L.P. The goal of this blog is to recapture that sort of excitement I used to have towards learning something new in this field which is why I will be documenting and discussing new things Iâ€™m learning whether it would be school work or independent studies. As a software engineer, I never want to stay stagnant. Ever.
