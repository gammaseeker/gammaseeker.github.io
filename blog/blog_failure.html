				<i>Sigh..</i>
				Let's try this again:
				Prompt: The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?
			</p>
			<p>
				I take everything for granted. That's what I've been told my entire life. I have big ideas sure, the ambition, but I could never bring them to life. I am always too focused on the future to appreciate what I have in the present. I want more prestige, I want to refine my talent, I want to be put on a pedestal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I entered my senior year with these three desires in mind. After the Con Edison Internship, I had found myself a support network, and finally saw success within myself. I was absolutely on top of the world and was ready to ride that momentum to generate more success in my final year of high school. 

			</p>
			<p>
				There was a certain vision that I had upon entering my final year of high school. Two conditions in which I could definitely say: "Senior year was a success. It was my Triumph!" The conditions were: admission to MIT, and getting the girl I liked. Scratch that, adored. Ironically, those successes were never generated. Rather, my year was filled with failure, one after another.
			</p>
			<p>
				The weight of sheer disappointment has yielded both a crippling feeling of unworthiness, and a deep desire to strive to become a better person. It is both beautiful and terrible that the only way I have grown is via failure, one after another.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, I have experienced the repercussions of my desires. A person who I held dear to me is now a stranger due to the actions I have made to chase my wants. I'll never forget that it ended like this. I'll never forget the deep-seated sting of interpersonal failure. But there's also another side to this tragedy, the hopeful fervor of Fall 2016, the fun times on the winter trip, the support network I've built up at Con Ed and the overall growth I've made from depression in freshman year to where I am today. The disappointments and losses will never take that away from me. With only 2 months remaining in my senior year of high school I cannot be certain that this relationship can be rekindled. However I absolutely refuse to allow this situation to happen again. These are my last 2 months, I won't take them for granted.
