			<h3>Chocolate Distribution Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                                Given an array A[] of N integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :<br />
                                <ol>
                                        <li>
                                                Each student gets one packet.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                                The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.
                                        </li>
                                </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Examples: <br />
                                Input : A[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12} <br />
                                m = 5 <br />
                                Output: Minimum Difference is 6 <br />
                                We may pick 3,4,7,9,9 and the output <br />
                                is 9-3 = 6 <br />
                        </p>

			<h3>Stock buy and sell</h3>
                        <p>
                                The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days. For example, if the given array is {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}, the maximum profit can earned by buying on day 0, selling on day 3. Again buy on day 4 and sell on day 6. If the given array of prices is sorted in decreasing order, then profit cannot be earned at all.
