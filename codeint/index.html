			How does the system work? <br /> Engineers will alternate between being the interviewer and interviewee. <br /><br /><strong>Interviewers:</strong> Are to solve interview problems ahead of time alone with the most efficient solution. When the interviewer and interviewee meet, they will conduct a mock interview for the same problem. Other responsibilities include
			<ul>
				<li>
					Pick their head for what they know
				</li>
				<li>
					Guide them if they get lost
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Study data structures and algorithms. Interviewee is to read and understand problem day before meeting date. Responsibilities include
			<ul>
				<li>
					Ask questions to remove ambiguity
				</li>
				<li>
					Discuss high level approach
				</li>
				<li>
					Annunciate thought process as you code
				</li>
			</ul>
