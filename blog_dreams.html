				As the anxiety inducing pi day (MIT result) is approaching, I've been reflecting more about my dreams. 
				MIT has been in my mind ever since 7th grade when my middle school took us on a trip in Boston. 
				One of our activities was a tour of Harvard, and on our way there via Massachusetts avenue, 
				we passed by a grand building with steps leading up to a platform supporting eight marble columns that held up a frieze that said "William Barton Rogers Founder."
				"And there is MIT, it's a good school for engineering," announced the tour guide. Although I was given such a brief introduction to the school, I decided that is <span class = "boldSpan"> where I wanted to go. </span>
			</p>

				Fast forward to April 23rd, 2016, MIT announced they were holding a open house event celebrating their 100 years in Cambridge. Upon hearing the news, I immediately rushed to my dad, convincing him to make the trip to Boston. We woke up at 4:00am and drove to Boston, arriving to MIT at 9:00am. As we crossed the Charles River to reach the school's entrance, we were greeted with a banner that read "Welcome to MIT." A surge of excitement struck my body as I realized I was about to experience the "nerd paradise." As I roamed throughout campus, I had the privilege of observing creative projects fueled by passion from an ice cream 3-D printer to a solar powered raspberry pi designed to mine bitcoins.

				Despite these innovative creations, what stuck with me most was that purple banner. When the college process began in senior year I entertained the idea of how great it would feel to see it again except welcoming students to the class of 2021. Welcoming me. Not as a visitor, but as a student. As a result, I promised myself that I would do all I can to see that "Welcome to MIT" banner again, but as a student.
			</p>
			<p>
				In exactly one week from today I will know if I get to see that banner again. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
